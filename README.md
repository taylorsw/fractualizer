# Fractualizer

Real-time ray-tracing and shading engine for visualizing music using animated 3D fractals.
The platform makes it easy to create new “stages” for visualization of audio using real-time beat detection and a fractal domain-specific language that transpiled to C# and HLSL to allow addition of new geometry with minimal work.
Built entirely from the ground-up with C#, C++, and DX11.
